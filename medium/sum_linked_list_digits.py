# The LL 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> None represents the number 431

# The weird version is long and it take too much memory. Adding zeros to the shorter list and then sum
# the values is a way of solving the problem, but is not the best way to do it. I think it is a good approach
# but is not as efficient as I would like. I feel that doing this in an interview is not the right thing to do.
